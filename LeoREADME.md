Hello CareerPlug-

I have never used Ruby on Rails before 12.6.18. I have learned a lot in the last few days and I hope to use that knowlege to complete this challenge.

I am starting the challenge at 4:30pm on 12.9.2018.
I had trouble testing a push to git with my LeoREADME.md file included. I have sent an email to Natalie about our issues and I will be attaching my code to that email.

Ran 'bin/rails server' command to find that the rake sources could not be found, so I 'bundle install'. Then I had to install yarn and npm, but we had to turn yarn check to false.

I was able to follow the instructions through except for implementing the edit comment feature.

Best,
Leo Shue Schuster
